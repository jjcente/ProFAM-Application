    "question": "A circular swimming pool has a diameter of 10 meters. A safety fence needs to be built around the pool, leaving a 1 meter walkway between the pool edge and the fence. What is the minimum length of fencing required (use π≈3.14)?",
    "answers": ["31.4 meters", "34.56 meters", "37.68 meters", "40.12 meters"],
    "correctIndex": 2,
    "solution": "The radius of the fence circle is 10/2 + 1 = 6 m. C = 2πr = 2 × 3.14 × 6 = 37.68 meters."

    "question": "A map uses a scale where 2 centimeters represents 5 kilometers in reality. Two cities are measured to be 15 centimeters apart on the map. What is the actual distance between the two cities in kilometers?",
    "answers": ["30.5 km", "37.5 km", "45.5 km", "50.5 km"],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "solution": "Scale factor = 5 km / 2 cm = 2.5 km/cm; Actual distance = 15 × 2.5 = 37.5 km."
