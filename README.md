# 🧮 ProFAM: PISA Framework-based Mathematics Game

## 🎮 Overview
**ProFAM** is a three-level educational math game designed to promote learning through interactive gameplay inspired by the **2022 PISA Mathematics Framework**.  
Each level presents a unique scenario that challenges players to apply mathematical reasoning and problem-solving skills in fun, engaging ways.

---

## 🧩 Game Concept
The game integrates **PISA-like math questions** within different gameplay mechanics, where players must answer questions correctly to progress or survive. Each level increases in complexity and cognitive demand, following the **PISA 2022 Mathematics Framework** (see Figure 3 of the project documentation).

## 🚀 Game Levels

### 🐟 Level 1 – “The Growing Fish”
- **Scenario:** The player controls a small fish in the ocean.
- **Objective:** Grow your fish by eating smaller fish that each carry a PISA math question.
- **Mechanics:**
  - Answer correctly → The fish grows by **+1 kg**.
  - Answer incorrectly → The fish **shrinks**, making survival harder.
  - Reach **exactly 10 kg** before the timer runs out to win.
- **Challenge:** Players must answer accurately and strategically to hit the goal weight within the time limit.

---

### 💣 Level 2 – “Bomb Defusal”
- **Scenario:** The player must defuse **five time bombs** scattered on the map.
- **Objective:** Answer all five PISA questions correctly before time expires.
- **Mechanics:**
  - Each bomb presents one PISA math question.
  - Correct answer → Bomb defused.
  - Incorrect answer or time expiration → Level restarts.
- **Challenge:** Shared **global timer** for all bombs adds tension and forces quick reasoning.

### 🧾 Level 3 – “Cashier Challenge”
- **Scenario:** The player acts as a **cashier** attending to 10 customers.
- **Objective:** Calculate the correct change and answer each customer’s PISA question.
- **Mechanics:**
  - Each customer asks **one PISA question** before the transaction.
  - Correct answer and correct change → Earn a **👍 (thumbs-up)**.
  - Wrong answer or incorrect change → Lose **2 thumbs-up units**.
  - Goal: Earn **10 thumbs-ups** to complete the level.
- **Challenge:** Combines arithmetic calculation, time pressure, and applied reasoning.
